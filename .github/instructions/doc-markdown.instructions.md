# Project documentation writing guidelines

## General Guidelines

- Write clear and concise documentation.
- Use consistent terminology and style.
- For each documentation context, **create two files with identical structure and content**, written in different languages:
  - One file in **Portuguese (pt-BR)**.
  - One file in **English (en-US)**.
- Keep both language versions synchronized. Any update made to one file **must be reflected in the other**.
- Include code examples where applicable.

## Language and File Structure

- Use the same file name and structure for both languages, differing only by language identifier if applicable.
- Ensure that headings, sections, and code examples are equivalent across both versions.
- Do not mix languages in the same file.

## Grammar

- Use present tense verbs (is, open) instead of past tense (was, opened).
- Write factual statements and direct commands. Avoid hypotheticals like "could" or "would".
- Use active voice where the subject performs the action.
- Write in second person (you) to speak directly to readers.

## Markdown Guidelines

- Use headings to organize content.
- Use bullet points for lists.
- Include links to related resources.
- Use code blocks for code snippets.
